A simple plugin that calculates two lowpass-filtered versions of abs(input) with filter time constants <code>t1</code> and <code>t2</code> and applies the inverse ratio of these two as scaling factor.

Optionally the ratio is taken to the <code>strength</code>'s power (defaults to 1) and the resulting ratio is clamped to lie between <code>minratio</code> and <code>maxratio</code>.
